# Builder Design Pattern

## What is it?
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Real-World Example
**Burger Builder:** When you order a burger, you can customize it (add cheese, lettuce, sauces, etc.). The builder assembles the burger step by step as per your choices.

## Key Points
- Useful for constructing complex objects step by step
- Increases code readability and flexibility
- Supports different representations of an object
