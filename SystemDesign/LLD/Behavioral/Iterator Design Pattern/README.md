# Iterator Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Real-World Example

**Playlist Navigation:** When you use a music app, you can go to the next or previous song in a playlist without knowing how the playlist is stored internally.

## Key Points

- Simplifies traversal of complex data structures
- Hides internal details of collections
- Supports multiple simultaneous traversals
