# Bridge Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Bridge pattern separates an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Real-World Example

**TV Remote and TV:** The remote (abstraction) can control different brands of TVs (implementations) without being changed for each brand.

## Key Points

- Decouples abstraction from implementation
- Increases flexibility and scalability
- Useful for systems with multiple dimensions of variation
