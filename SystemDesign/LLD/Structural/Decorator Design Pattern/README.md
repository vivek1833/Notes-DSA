# Decorator Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

## Real-World Example

**Coffee Shop:** You order a coffee and add extras like milk, sugar, or whipped cream. Each extra is a decorator that adds to the base coffee.

## Key Points

- Adds behavior to objects at runtime
- Promotes code flexibility and reusability
- Avoids subclass explosion
