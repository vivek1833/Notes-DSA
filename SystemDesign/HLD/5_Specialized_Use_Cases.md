# 5. High-Level Design for Specialized Use Cases

## Designing for Real-Time Applications

### Real-Time Data Processing

- Applications like chat, gaming, and notifications require instant data delivery.

**Java Example (WebSocket):**

```java
@ServerEndpoint("/ws/chat")
public class ChatEndpoint {
    @OnMessage
    public String onMessage(String message) {
        return "Echo: " + message;
    }
}
```

### Real-Time Messaging

- Use message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for scalable, reliable delivery.

### WebSocket vs HTTP

- **WebSocket:** Bi-directional, persistent connection for real-time.
- **HTTP:** Request-response, not ideal for real-time.

## Cloud-Native System Design

### Serverless Architectures

- Run code without managing servers (e.g., AWS Lambda, GCP Functions).

### Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing

- Automatically adjust resources based on demand.

### Cloud Platforms

- AWS, Azure, GCP offer managed services for storage, compute, networking.

### Cloud Cost Optimization

- Use right-sized resources, auto-scaling, and reserved instances to save costs.

**Java Example (AWS Lambda Handler):**

```java
public class LambdaHandler implements RequestHandler<Request, Response> {
    public Response handleRequest(Request input, Context context) {
        // Business logic
    }
}
```

## Designing for Machine Learning Systems

### Integration of ML Models

- Deploy trained models as REST APIs or microservices.

### Data Pipelines for ML

- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare data for training and inference.

### Model Serving

- Use frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or custom Java microservices.

**Java Example (Spring Boot ML Inference):**

```java
@RestController
public class PredictionController {
    @PostMapping("/predict")
    public Prediction predict(@RequestBody InputData data) {
        // Call ML model and return prediction
    }
}
```

## Designing for Edge Computing

### Edge vs Cloud Computing

- **Edge:** Processing data near the source (IoT, vehicles).
- **Cloud:** Centralized processing in data centers.

### Use Cases

- IoT, autonomous vehicles, real-time analytics.

**Java Example (Edge Device Data Upload):**

```java
public void uploadSensorData(SensorData data) {
    // Send data to edge gateway or cloud
}
```

## Designing for Video Streaming and Content Delivery

### Scalable Video Streaming

- Use distributed servers and CDNs to deliver video content efficiently.

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

- Cache and serve content from locations close to users.

### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

- Adjust video quality based on user's network speed.

**Java Example (Pseudo-code for Adaptive Streaming):**

```java
public VideoChunk getChunk(int bitrate, int segment) {
    // Return video chunk for given bitrate and segment
}
```

**Summary:**

- Specialized HLD use cases require tailored design patterns and technologies.
- Java code samples illustrate practical solutions for each scenario.
