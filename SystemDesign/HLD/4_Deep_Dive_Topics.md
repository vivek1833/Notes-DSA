# 4. Deep-Dive Topics in High-Level Design

## Designing for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Developers merge code changes frequently into a shared repository.
- Automated builds and tests ensure code quality.

**Java Example (JUnit Test):**

```java
@Test
public void testAddition() {
    assertEquals(4, 2 + 2);
}
```

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

- Automated deployment of code to production or staging environments.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Two environments (blue and green); switch traffic to new version after testing.
- **Canary Release:** Gradually roll out new version to a subset of users.

### Version Control

- Track code changes (e.g., Git).

**Java Example (Git Command):**

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

## Designing for Monitoring and Logging

### Centralized Logging

- Collect logs from all services in one place (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).

### Distributed Tracing

- Track requests as they flow through microservices (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).

### Metrics Collection and Alerting

- Monitor system health (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

### Health Checks and Self-Healing

- Services expose endpoints (e.g., /health) for monitoring.

**Java Example (Spring Boot Health Endpoint):**

```java
// Add dependency: spring-boot-starter-actuator
// /actuator/health endpoint provides health status
```

## Designing for Data Privacy and Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- Protect user data, allow deletion, inform users about data usage.

### Data Masking and Anonymization

- Hide or obfuscate sensitive data.

**Java Example (Masking):**

```java
public String maskEmail(String email) {
    int at = email.indexOf('@');
    return "****" + email.substring(at);
}
```

### Data Retention Policies

- Define how long data is stored and when it is deleted.

---

## Designing for Multi-Tenancy

### Single Tenant vs Multi-Tenant

- **Single Tenant:** One customer per instance (better isolation).
- **Multi-Tenant:** Multiple customers share resources (cost-effective).

### Isolating Tenant Data

- Use tenant IDs in database tables.

**Java Example (Tenant Filter):**

```java
public List<Order> getOrdersForTenant(String tenantId) {
    // Query DB with tenantId filter
}
```

### Resource Allocation

- Allocate resources (CPU, memory) per tenant as needed.

---

## Designing for Mobile Applications

### Mobile Client-Server Architecture

- Mobile app communicates with backend via REST APIs.

### Optimizing Mobile API Responses

- Use pagination, data compression to reduce payload.

**Java Example (Pagination):**

```java
@GetMapping("/products")
public List<Product> getProducts(@RequestParam int page, @RequestParam int size) {
    // Return paginated products
}
```

### Offline Capabilities

- Store data locally and sync when online.

**Java Example (Room Database for Android):**

```java
@Entity
public class Note {
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    public int id;
    public String content;
}
```

**Summary:**

- Deep-dive HLD topics ensure systems are maintainable, compliant, and user-friendly.
- Java code samples show practical implementation for each area.
