# Design Blogging Platform – Content Management System (CMS)

## 📋 Problem Statement

Design a scalable blogging platform (like Medium, WordPress.com) that allows users to:

- Publish, edit, and delete articles (rich text, images, embeds)
- Comment, like, and share articles
- Follow authors and receive personalized feeds
- Tag, categorize, and search content
- Support drafts, scheduled publishing, and version history
- Ensure high availability, scalability, and security

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

### Core Features

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Latency**: < 300ms for feed/search, < 1s for publishing
- **Scalability**: 10M+ users, 100M+ articles
- **Consistency**: Strong for publishing, eventual for feeds
- **Security**: Data privacy, access control, anti-abuse

  "followers": ["userId1", "userId2"],
  "following": ["userId1", "userId2"],
  "createdAt": "date"
}
```

### Article Schema

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "authorId": "ObjectId",
  "title": "string",
  "content": "string (HTML/Markdown)",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "categories": ["cat1", "cat2"],
  "status": "draft|published|scheduled|deleted",
  "version": 3,
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date",
  "publishedAt": "date|null"
}
```

### Comment Schema

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "articleId": "ObjectId",
  "userId": "ObjectId",
  "text": "string",

  "replies": ["commentId1", "commentId2"]
}
```

## 🚀 Feed Generation

- Rate limiting, anti-abuse

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure media URLs (signed URLs, expiry)
- Moderation for comments, articles

### Privacy

- User-controlled privacy settings
- GDPR compliance

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Feed

- Precompute feeds for active users
- Use Redis for hot feed caching
- Efficient pagination (cursor-based)

### Search

- Elasticsearch for indexing
- Autocomplete, trending queries
