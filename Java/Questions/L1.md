# ✅ Java Interview Questions - Level 1

## 1. Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode. It is platform-dependent but provides a platform-independent execution environment for Java programs. It handles memory management, garbage collection, and runtime optimizations.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Provides libraries, JVM, and components necessary to run Java applications. It does not contain development tools like compiler/debugger.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Superset of JRE, includes tools like compiler (`javac`), debugger, JavaDoc, and other utilities for developing and running Java applications.

---

## 2. Main Features of Java (OOP Principles)

- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping data (fields) and methods together. Achieved using access modifiers.
- **Inheritance:** Code reusability by deriving classes from parent classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to use one interface with multiple implementations (method overloading and overriding).
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.

---

## 3. Primitive Data Types in Java

- byte (8-bit)
- short (16-bit)
- int (32-bit)
- long (64-bit)
- float (32-bit)
- double (64-bit)
- char (16-bit Unicode)
- boolean (true/false)

---

## 4. Autoboxing and Unboxing

- **Autoboxing:** Automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object.
- **Unboxing:** Conversion of wrapper object back to primitive.

```java
Integer x = 10; // Autoboxing
int y = x;     // Unboxing
```

---

## 5. Access Modifiers

- **private:** Accessible only within the same class.
- **default (no modifier):** Accessible within the same package.
- **protected:** Accessible within package and subclasses.
- **public:** Accessible everywhere.

---

## 6. Package in Java

- A package groups related classes and interfaces together. Provides modularization and prevents naming conflicts.

```java
package com.myapp.utils;
```

---

## 7. Static Keyword

- **static variables:** Shared among all objects of a class (class-level memory).
- **static methods:** Belong to the class, can be accessed without creating an object.
- **static blocks:** Used for static initializations.

---

## 8. Constructor in Java

- Special method to initialize objects.

### Types:

- Default constructor (no args)
- Parameterized constructor
- Copy constructor (custom in Java)

```java
class Person {
   String name;
   Person(String n) { this.name = n; }
}
```

---

## 9. Can we use static methods in a constructor?

- Yes, you can call static methods from a constructor, but you cannot declare a constructor as static.

---

## 10. Inheritance in Java

- Mechanism of deriving a class from another class.

### Types:

- Single
- Multilevel
- Hierarchical
- Multiple (via interfaces only)

---

## 11. Polymorphism

- **Compile-time (method overloading).**
- **Runtime (method overriding).**

```java
class Shape {
    void draw(){}
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw(){
        System.out.println("Circle");
    }
}
```

---

## 12. Encapsulation vs Abstraction

- **Encapsulation:** Hides data using access modifiers (focus on _how data is accessed_).
- **Abstraction:** Hides implementation details using abstract classes/interfaces (focus on _what operations are exposed_).

---

## 13. Interface vs Abstract Class

- **Interface:** For full abstraction, multiple inheritance, all methods abstract (till Java 7). Supports default/static methods (Java 8+).
- **Abstract class:** Can have concrete + abstract methods, constructors, fields.

---

## 14. Marker Interface

- Interface without methods. Used to mark classes for special behavior by JVM/Frameworks.
- Example: `Serializable`, `Cloneable`.

---

## 15. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

- **String:** Immutable, thread-safe, stored in String pool.
- **StringBuilder:** Mutable, not thread-safe, better performance in single-threaded scenarios.
- **StringBuffer:** Mutable, thread-safe (synchronized).

---

## 16. String literal vs new operator

- **String literal:** Stored in string pool, reused if already exists.
- **new operator:** Always creates a new object in heap.

---

## 17. String Pool

- A special memory region inside the heap where string literals are stored and reused.

---

## 18. Advantages of String Pool

- Saves memory, improves performance.

---

## 19. Why String is immutable?

- For thread-safety, security (hashcode caching, classloader integrity), and memory efficiency.

---

## 20. Collection in Java

- A framework that provides classes and interfaces for storing/manipulating groups of objects. Example: `List`, `Set`, `Map`.

---

## 21. Array vs ArrayList

- **Array:** Fixed size, stores primitives and objects.
- **ArrayList:** Dynamic size, stores only objects, part of Collections framework.

---

## 22. ArrayList vs LinkedList

- **ArrayList:** Backed by dynamic array, faster random access.
- **LinkedList:** Doubly-linked list, faster insert/delete in middle.

---

## 23. HashMap

- Key-value pair storage, O(1) average operations.

```java
Map<String,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("a",1);
```

---

## 24. HashSet vs TreeSet

- **HashSet:** Unordered, allows null, O(1) operations.
- **TreeSet:** Sorted, no nulls, O(log n) operations.

---

## 25. Iterator

- Object to traverse collections. Supports fail-fast iteration.

---

## 26-28. Set vs List vs Array

- **Set:** Unique elements, unordered (HashSet) or sorted (TreeSet).
- **List:** Ordered, allows duplicates (ArrayList, LinkedList).
- **Array:** Fixed size, stores primitives/objects.

---

## 29. Exception

- Abnormal event disrupting program flow.

### Types:

- Checked
- Unchecked
- Error

---

## 30. Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

- **Checked:** Compile-time (IOException, SQLException).
- **Unchecked:** Runtime (NullPointerException, ArithmeticException).

---

## 31. try-catch-finally

- **try:** Risky code.
- **catch:** Handle exception.
- **finally:** Always executes (closing resources).

---

## 32. Can try without catch?

- Yes, if finally is present.

---

## 33. throw vs throws

- **throw:** Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- **throws:** Declares exceptions in method signature.

---

## 34. User-defined exceptions

- Custom exception classes extending Exception/RuntimeException.
- Exception - checked (compile-time) , RuntimeException - unchecked (run-time).

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String msg){
        super(msg);
    }
}
```

## 35. Exception Hierarchy

- In Java, all exceptions inherit from the Throwable class, which has two main branches: `Error` and `Exception`.

  - `Error` represents serious problems (like OutOfMemoryError) that applications should not try to handle.
  - `Exception` is for conditions that applications might want to catch and handle.

- Under Exception, we have:
  - Checked exceptions – Must be declared in method signatures or caught. Example: `IOException`, `SQLException`.
  - Unchecked exceptions – Subclasses of RuntimeException, which the compiler does not force you to handle. Example: `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`.

```
java.lang.Throwable
│
├── Error (Unrecoverable, system-level errors)
│   └── OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, etc.
│
└── Exception (Recoverable, application-level errors)
    │
    ├── Checked Exceptions (Must be declared or caught)
    │   ├── IOException
    │   ├── SQLException
    │   ├── ClassNotFoundException
    │   └── CustomCheckedException (extends Exception)
    │
    └── Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime exceptions)
        ├── NullPointerException
        ├── IllegalArgumentException
        ├── IndexOutOfBoundsException
        ├── ArithmeticException
        └── CustomUncheckedException (extends RuntimeException)
```

---

## 36. NullPointerException

- Occurs when calling methods on null references.
- Prevention: Use Optional, null checks, defensive coding.

---

## 37. ClassCastException

- Occurs during invalid typecasting.

---

## 38. Error vs Exception

- **Error:** Serious system issues (OutOfMemoryError).
- **Exception:** Recoverable program issues.

---

## 39. break vs continue

- **break:** Exits loop.
- **continue:** Skips current iteration.

---

## 40. == vs equals()

- **==** compares references.
- **equals()** compares values (can be overridden).

---

## 41. @SpringBootApplication

- Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan`.

---

## 42. @Component vs @Service vs @Repository

- **@Component:** Generic component.
- **@Service:** Business logic.
- **@Repository:** Persistence/DAO layer, exception translation.

---

## 43. Dependency Injection

- Design pattern where dependencies are injected rather than created inside a class.

---

## 44. @Autowired

- Annotation for automatic dependency injection.

---

## 45. Spring Boot Starters

- Predefined dependencies for specific features (`spring-boot-starter-web`, etc).

---

## 46. application.properties

- External configuration file for Spring Boot apps.

---

## 47. Spring vs Spring Boot

- **Spring:** Core framework, manual configuration.
- **Spring Boot:** Opinionated, auto-configuration, production-ready defaults.

---

## 48. IOC Container in Spring

- Inversion of Control container manages lifecycle, dependencies, and configuration of beans.

---

## 49. Component vs Configuration

- `@Component` and `@Configuration` are both Spring-managed beans, but they serve slightly different purposes.
- `@Component` is a generic stereotype for any Spring bean. The container manages its lifecycle, and by default it’s a singleton.
- `@Configuration` is a specialized type of @Component used to declare @Bean methods. Spring creates a CGLIB proxy of the configuration class to ensure that @Bean methods return singleton instances even if they’re called internally within the class.
- So the key difference is: `@Configuration` enables proxying of internal method calls, guaranteeing singleton consistency for beans defined inside it, whereas @Component does not.
- A good rule of thumb: use `@Configuration` for bean factory classes and @Component for regular service or repository beans.

---

## 50. Overriding: Method Call in Constructor with static

```java
class A {
    A() { show(); }

    static void show() { System.out.println("A show"); }
}

class B extends A {
    static int x = 10;

    static void show() { System.out.println("B show: " + x);}
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new B().show();
        // A Show B Show 10
    }
}
```

- `A` constructor is called. `A.show()` is called, since it is static it is called from `A`, hence `A Show`. If it was not static, `B.show()` would have been called.
- `B.show()` is called. `B.show()` is called from `B` because it is static, hence `B Show 10`.

---

### 51. The rule of `super()` and `this()`

- If a constructor starts with `super(...):` It calls the corresponding superclass constructor.

- If a constructor starts with `this(...):` It calls another constructor within the same class. The compiler inserts the implicit super() into the final constructor in the chain.f

- If a constructor starts with neither: The compiler inserts the implicit super().
