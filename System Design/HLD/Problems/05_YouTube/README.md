# Design YouTube – Video Hosting & Streaming

## 📋 Problem Statement

Design a video hosting, streaming, recommendation engine that can handle:
- Video upload, storage, and distribution
- User authentication and authorization
- Video playback, comments, and recommendations
- Search and filtering of videos
- Live streaming support
- Real-time analytics and insights

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Video Upload, Storage, and Distribution**: Users can upload, store, and distribute videos on the platform
2. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Users need to register and log in to access the platform 
3. **Video Playback, Comments, and Recommendations**: Users can watch videos, leave comments, and receive personalized recommendations
4. **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for videos based on keywords and filters
5. **Live Streaming Support**: Users can watch live streams of videos in real-time
6. **Real-time Analytics and Insights**: The platform provides real-time analytics and insights to help users make informed decisions 

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **Latency**: <= 200ms for real-time updates
- **Scalability**: Support large-scale user base and video distribution
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency for real-time updates
- **Security**: Authenticated users only can access their own content
