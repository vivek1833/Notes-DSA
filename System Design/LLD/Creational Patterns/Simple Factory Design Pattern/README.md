# Simple Factory Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Simple Factory pattern is not a formal GoF pattern but is widely used. It uses a single factory class to create instances of different types based on input.

## Real-World Example

**Pizza Store:** When you order a pizza, the store (factory) decides which type of pizza to make based on your order (input).

## Key Points

- Centralizes object creation
- Simplifies client code
- Not as flexible as other factory patterns
