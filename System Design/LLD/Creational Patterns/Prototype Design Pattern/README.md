# Prototype Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This is useful when object creation is costly.

## Real-World Example

**Resume Templates:** When you create a new resume, you often start by copying a template and then modifying it, rather than starting from scratch.

## Key Points

- Clones objects instead of creating from scratch
- Useful for expensive or complex object creation
- Supports shallow and deep copying
