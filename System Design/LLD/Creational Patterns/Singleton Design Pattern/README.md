# Singleton Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Real-World Example

**Printer Spooler:** In an office, there should be only one printer spooler to manage print jobs. If multiple programs try to print, they all go through the same spooler instance.

## Key Points

- Restricts instantiation of a class to one object
- Useful for shared resources like configuration, logging, or connection pools
- Provides a global access point
