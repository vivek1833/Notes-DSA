# Observer Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Real-World Example

**Social Media Notifications:** When you follow someone, you get notified whenever they post something new. You (observer) are updated when the person you follow (subject) changes state.

## Key Points

- Promotes loose coupling
- Useful for event-driven systems
- Common in GUIs and real-time applications
