# State Design Pattern

## What is it?

The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

## Real-World Example

**Traffic Light:** A traffic light changes its behavior (color and allowed actions) based on its current state (red, yellow, green).

## Key Points

- Encapsulates state-specific behavior
- Makes state transitions explicit
- Useful for objects with complex state-dependent behavior
