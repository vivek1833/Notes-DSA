# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Real-World Example

**Customer Support System:** When you raise a support ticket, it first goes to a basic support agent. If they can't solve it, it's escalated to a supervisor, and so on. Each level decides if it can handle your issue or pass it along.

## Key Points

- Decouples sender and receiver of a request
- Flexible chain of processing objects
- Useful for scenarios like logging, event handling, or approval workflows
