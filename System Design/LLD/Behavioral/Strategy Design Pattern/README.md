# Strategy Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The algorithm can vary independently from clients that use it.

## Real-World Example

**Navigation Apps:** You can choose different routes (fastest, shortest, avoid tolls) to reach your destination. Each route is a strategy.

## Key Points

- Promotes flexibility and reusability
- Useful for selecting algorithms at runtime
- Reduces conditional statements
