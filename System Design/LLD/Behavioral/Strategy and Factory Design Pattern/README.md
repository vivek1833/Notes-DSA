# Strategy and Factory Design Pattern

## What is it?

This combines the Strategy and Factory patterns. The Factory pattern is used to create objects (strategies) based on input, and the Strategy pattern is used to select and execute the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

## Real-World Example

**Payment Gateways:** When you check out online, you can choose to pay by card, UPI, or wallet. The system uses a factory to create the right payment strategy and then executes it.

## Key Points

- Combines object creation and algorithm selection
- Useful for systems needing both flexibility and scalability
