# Composite Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Composite pattern lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Real-World Example

**File System:** Folders can contain files or other folders. You can perform operations like open, delete, or move on both files and folders in the same way.

## Key Points

- Treats individual and composite objects uniformly
- Useful for hierarchical structures (e.g., file systems, organization charts)
- Simplifies client code
