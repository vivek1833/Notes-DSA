# Proxy Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Real-World Example

**Internet Proxy:** When you use a proxy server to access the internet, the proxy acts as an intermediary between you and the website, controlling and sometimes caching your requests.

## Key Points

- Controls access to another object
- Can add security, logging, or caching
- Useful for resource-intensive or remote objects
