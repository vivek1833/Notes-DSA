# Adapter Design Pattern

## What is it?

The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another expected by the client.

## Real-World Example

**Power Plug Adapter:** When you travel to another country, you use a plug adapter to connect your device to a differently shaped socket.

## Key Points

- Bridges incompatible interfaces
- Promotes code reusability
- Useful for integrating legacy or third-party code
