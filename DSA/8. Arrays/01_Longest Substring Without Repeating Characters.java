    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

    ------------------------------

    Example 1:
        Input: s = "abcabcbb"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

    Example 2:
        Input: s = "bbbbb"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    
    Example 3:
        Input: s = "pwwkew"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
    
    ------------------------------

    Constraints:
        - 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
        - s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
