    Problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-bitonic-subsequence0824/1

    Given an array of positive integers. Find the maximum length of Bitonic subsequence. 
    A subsequence of array is called Bitonic if it is first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Return the maximum length of bitonic subsequence.
    
    Note : A strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence should not be considered as a bitonic sequence

    ----------------------------

    Example 1:
        Input: n = 5, nums[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 2]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The sequence [1, 2, 5] is increasing and the sequence [3, 2] is decreasing so merging both we will get length 5.

    Example 2:
        Input: n = 8, nums[] = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]
        Output: 6
        Explanation: The bitonic sequence [1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1] has length 6.
    
    Example 3:
        Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 20, 30]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: The decreasing or increasing part cannot be empty.
    
    Example 4:
        Input: n = 3, nums[] = [10, 10, 10]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: No strictly increasing or decreasing sequence exists.
    
    ----------------------------
    
    Constraints:
        - 1 ≤ length of array ≤ 103
        - 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
